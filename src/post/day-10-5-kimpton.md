[Kimpton Maa-Lai](https://www.kimptonmaalaibangkok.com) is a luxury hotel. It is situated near Lumphini Park in the very posh neighbourhood along Soi Ton Son.

The room that Belinda stayed in is huge, bigger than the apartment accommodating 5 of us, and has fantastic views of the surrounding area.

We elected to have lunch at the hotel restaurant, and had a mixture of up market versions of standard Thai dishes, and after that we wandered around the gardens surrounding the hotel and took some photos.
