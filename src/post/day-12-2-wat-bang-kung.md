Wat Bang Kung วัดบางกุ้ง ([Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/pages/วัดบางกุ้ง%20โบสถ์ปรกโพธ์%20อ.บางคนที%20จ.สมุทรสงคราม/961583520599818/?locale=th_TH&_rdc=1&_rdr)) is an ancient temple in Samut Songkhram, Thailand, built during the Ayutthaya period. It was the site of the Battle of Bang Kung, between the Konbaung dynasty and the Thonburi Kingdom. The temple is covered with various roots, which help support the ubosot. Inside, there is a statue of Buddha and a mural depicting the story of his life.

It is is interesting that the temple site has many sculptures depicting the Battle of Bang Kung.
