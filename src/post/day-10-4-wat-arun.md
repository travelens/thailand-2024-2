[Wat Arun Ratchawararam Ratchawaramahawihan วัดอรุณราชวรารามราชวรมหาวิหาร](https://www.wat-arun.com) is an iconic Bangkok landmark, with it's imposing 82m tall spire (Prang) situated next to the Chao Phraya river. A buddhist temple has existed at this site since the Ayutthaya Kingdom. 1351–1767 AD, however the origins of the temple appears to be Hindu - it derives its name from the hindu god Aruna. embodied as the radiations of the rising sun. The central spire symbolises Mount Meru from hindu cosmology which is considered to be the centre of all physical, metaphysical and spiritual universes.

King Taksin (1734–82), who established the Thonburi Kingdom following the fall of Ayutthaya, established his capital around Wat Arun and brought with him the Emerald Buddha (originally from Vientiane, Laos) - the Emerald Buddha as we know is now located at the Wat Ubosot in the Grand Palace,

The surrounding spires are devoted to the wind God, Phra Phai. The giant white figurine is Sahassa Deja and the giant green figurine is Thotsakan. The Giants (yaksha) face in four directions to offer protection. The central spire is topped with a seven pronged trident, known as "Trident of Shiva". At the second terrace there are four statues of the Hindu God Indra riding on Erawan, (a colossal elephant with three heads). Around the base of the spire are various figures of ancient Chinese soldiers.

It is possible to climb the stairs of the central spire to get a good view of Bangkok, but we were too tired and elected not to undertake the task.
