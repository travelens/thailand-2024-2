Today we embarked on a road trip to stay at a riverside house near Amphawa. The plan is to eat along the way, and visit the Amphawa Floating Market. Two of Cat's friends, Nuch and Mam, decided to join us on the trip so we are 8 in all.

We stopped by at a rest stop/petrol station along the way to buy some snacks and drinks, and encountered a lovely huge fluffy dog that we all gave lots of attention to.

We rented out a house at [Baankwaeom Boutique Homestay](http://www.baankwaeom.com/index.php) บ้านแควอ้อมบูติคโฮมสเตย์อัมพวา, beside the Khwae Om canal. It is called Tara House, and it is a very interesting property. The ground floor is a living room, a kitchen and 2 bathrooms. Upstairs is a single bedroom that sleeps up to 8 people in 4 beds. Nearby is Baan Cafe which served us some food on arrival and will also serve us breakfast the next day. The property is owned by a friend of Cat - Mam
