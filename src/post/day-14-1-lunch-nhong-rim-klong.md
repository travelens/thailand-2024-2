Formerly located by the canal as a food stall, Nhong Rim Klong is now located at Ekkamai Soi 23. It is a casual dining ambience with simple furniture and a semi-open kitchen concept. The restaurant is also listed on the Michelin Bib Gourmand list for Bangkok in 2023.

It is not easy to get to by public transport, so we opted to catch a Grab there. The place has been made famous through social media, very soon after we arrived there was already a queue forming outside.

It took quite a while for the food to arrive. I must admit, I was a little disappointed. After all the hype, the food is fairly ordinary and I am not sure I will come back here again.
