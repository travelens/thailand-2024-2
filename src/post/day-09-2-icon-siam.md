In the afternoon we took a taxi to [Icon Siam ไอคอนสยาม](https://www.iconsiam.com/th). The intention is to explore [Sook Siam](http://www.sooksiam.com) - the amazing recreation of a floating market in the ground floor of the massive shopping centre.

The taxi took a long time to get to Icon Siam, mainly because the traffic was so heavy.

The amount of stalls selling food and other products here is truly amazing - I have never seen such a bewildering array of different food available under one roof before. And the recreationg of a floating market is quite cute, complete with elephant and shrine.

This video gives a good idea of Sook Siam and how massive it is:

After that, we left Icon Siam and walked along the river promenade to catch a river boat to Asiatique.
