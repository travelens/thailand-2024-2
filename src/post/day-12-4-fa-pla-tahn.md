Safely back in Bangkok after the road trip, we decided to venture to Central Embassy and Childlom in search of dinner and to do some shopping.

ฟ้าปลาทาน เซ็นทรัล ชิดลม Fá Plā Tahń at Central Childlom ([Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/faplatahn/)) is a restaurant specialising in Khao Tom Pla, or boiled rice soup with fish. Their speciality seems to be Teochew style "fish noodles" - the noodles are actually made out of fish paste, and typically served with fish balls and minced pork. The food is expensive by Bangkok standards, but reasonable by Australian standards.

I really enjoyed my bowl of fish noodles and would happily come back here again.
