We alighted from the river boat and arrived at [Asiatique เอเชียทีค เดอะ ริเวอร์ฟรอนท์](https://www.asiatiquethailand.com), the Riverfront, a large open-air mall in Bangkom facing the Chao Phraya River and Charoen Krung Road at the former docks of the East Asiatic Company. Here there are many stores selling clothes, food stalls and restaurants.

We came here to watch the [Calypso Cabaret คาลิปโซ่ คาบาเร่ต์](https://calypsocabaret.com). Our ticket includes not just the cabaret performance, but also a meal and a traditional Thai Classical Dance performance.

Here we met Belinda, who had just arrived from Bangkok in the morning and would be spending the next few days with us.

I was surprised that the dinner was quite tasty and filling, and the Thai Classical performance was a variety of numbers similar to the Khum Khantoke event we attended in Chiang Mai.

The show itself was fabulous, the production was very professionals, the dancers are very good, and the numbers range from amazing to funny. Here are two performances that I recorded:
