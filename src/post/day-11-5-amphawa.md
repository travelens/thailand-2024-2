[Amphawa Floating Market](https://amphawafloatingmarket.org) is located in the province of Samut Songkhram, Thailand, Amphawa Floating Market (ตลาดน้ำอัมพวา) is a vibrant and colourful market set against the stunning backdrop of the Mae Khlong River. There are a myriad of food stalls and other shops selling local items and handicrafts.

I was amazed at the variety of food here, including huge grilled river prawns, various kinds of skewers and sausages. We ended up ordering probably too much, and had a delightful time in the riverfront eating, and then walked around visiting the stalls and enjoying the various boats in the canal carrying tourists.
