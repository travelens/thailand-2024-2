We took our first BTS train to Yaowarat (changing over to the Metro to reach our final destination):

Yaowarat Rd is the main artery of Bangkok's Chinatown, and every night it is full of food stalls. We saw many interesting stalls selling anything from giant oysters to sculptured 3D ice cream to all kinds of food, even shark fins and bird nests.

We couldn't help but stop at the famous Plaeng Nam Shark Fin-Bird’s Nest（義福巷燕窩). I was not game enough to try the shark fin soup, but I had the crab fried rice and tasted the fish maw soup.

After that we also tried the famous wanton mee at the junction of Yaowarat Road and Yaowa Phanit called Mung Korn Khao Noodle.

After that, we walked around Yaowarat Rd and stopped by a Thai dessert stall to have coconut ice cream desserts. All in all it was a very interesting night, and I really wished I could have eaten more.

Here is a good video that gives an idea of what the experience of walking around Yaowarat Rd is like:
