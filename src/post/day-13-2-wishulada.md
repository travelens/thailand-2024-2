[Wishulada Panthanuvong](https://www.wishulada-art.com) is an environmental artist who challenges conventional thinking by transforming waste materials into valuable artworks. I visited her exhibition ["Adaptation: The Coexistence of "Trace" and "Transformation"](https://www.bangkokartcity.org/discover-detail/adaptation) at noble PLAY, a creative space in Phloen Chit (which hosted the event from 07th October 2024 to 26th January 2025).

Wishulada Panthanuvong’s exhibition "Adaptation: The Coexistence of "Trace" and "Transformation" is an artistic work that depicts the evolution of an expanding metropolis. The environment bears witness to the transformations that have transpired due to human activity and urbanization. Despite the damage, artist Wishulada turns the rubble into a beacon of hope, with the inscription "Trace". While the message of "Transformation" from past mistakes seeks to guide people away from destructive habits and toward a more sustainable way of life.

noble PLAY and Wishulada Panthanuvong share a common goal to enhance environmental awareness, encourage the use of waste resources, and develop the environment for optimum advantage through this exhibition. Works in the exhibition are created from a variety of construction waste materials; these artworks challenge the conventional wisdom about "worthless things that everyone overlooks." The artist's work also encourages people to think about the complex interactions between humans, the environment, and the metropolis.

This exhibition delves into the underlying significance of adaptability and sustainable cohabitation in a fast-changing world, utilizing art as a communication tool to encourage visitors to reflect on their own role in society and the environment.

The artist Wishulada creates works through questioning and discovery to inspire people to 'remember' the lessons of past unfriendly environmental actions, 'adapt' their way of life, be conscious of how to make the best use of available resources, and collaborate to create a sustainable future.

"Adaptation: The Coexistence of "Trace" and "Transformation" is an exhibition where you may discover...

## Three-Tree Transformation

"Installation Art" repurposes construction materials such steel bars, pipes, bricks, tile and cement to create "Three-Tree Transformation," which may assume three distinct forms for Halloween, Christmas, and Chinese New Year festivities.

Urban construction traces transformed into symbolic artworks reveal not just the adaptability, curiosity, and openness of the artists, but also the society at large.
The exhibition invites viewers to ponder and question the essence of coexistence in a multicultural society, while also providing a fresh space for learning and exchanging ideas. Encourage everyone to adapt, open their minds to tolerate differences, and reconsider their stance on coexistence.

## A "Concrete Jungle Blossoms"

Enter a fantastical realm where construction debris takes the form of trees, complete with sturdy trunks and branches that extend across the exhibition space.
Recycled plastic bottles and plastic bags, as well as multicolored vinyl pieces, are braided into leaves, flowers, and fruits to make a magnificent tree transformation.
While the box made of vinyl remnants is a sobering reminder of the effects of consumer culture, it is also a hopeful sign of the potential for repurposing unwanted items into art that raises environmental consciousness.

The "Concrete Jungle Blossoms" initiative brings together urbanites, nature, and the built environment. The strategically placed benches invite visitors to pause, converse, exchange ideas, and build small communities that develop in tandem with the tree transformation.
In a rapidly changing world, this exhibition reflects the importance of adaptation for both human and nature’s survival. It is a reminder of the impact of mindless consumption while also inspiring people to take collective action toward a greener tomorrow.

## "Finale: turning a page... towards a fresh start"

Open the door to the behind-the-scenes world of art creation, where inspiration, creativity, and the artist's working process merge. The exhibition demonstrates the sustainable coexistence of humans and nature in a constantly evolving world.

This exhibition serves as a catalyst for learning and exploration, encouraging creativity and raising awareness that there is only one world and limited resources. Using resources wisely and sustainably means leaving preserve space for future generations to grow sustainably.

## “SUSTAINABLE MAP: Map of Bangkok, Thailand”

This exhibition explores Bangkok through an artistic lens that combines beauty and sustainability. The exhibition draws inspiration from over 300 kilograms of construction waste and recycled materials for creating stories about 179 prominent places in Bangkok, including well-known restaurants, trendy cafes, museums, and religious sites.
By simply scanning the QR code, visitors can discover nearby attractions, creating a one-of-a-kind travel experience, benefiting the local economy, and increasing public awareness of tourist destinations.

The artwork exemplifies the circular economy concept by repurposing discarded materials into works of art and connecting trash recycling to generate cash for the community, demonstrating the power of creativity and the importance of adaptation. It serves as a reminder to be mindful of the environmental impact of our consumption and an encouragement for people to work together to create a sustainable future.
