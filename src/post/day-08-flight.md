We checked out of the house we were staying, and took a van to Chiang Mai airport. We boarded the flight at around 12pm and landed early, around 1:30pm to [Suvarnabhumi Airport](https://www.bangkokairportonline.com) (ท่าอากาศยานสุวรรณภูมิ).

We had prebooked an airport transfer van through the AirBNB property we are staying in Bangkok so we didn't wait very long at the airport. The trip to the apartment at Mahatun took a lot faster that we anticipated because traffic was quite light at that time.
