[Terminal 21](https://www.terminal21.co.th) เทอร์มินอล21​ อโศก is my favourite shopping centre in Bangkok because it is like a theme park - each floor is meant to evocate a city or location in the world, so it brings the dream of traveling the world to downtown Bangkok, with its unique concept that places several world-famous cities under one roof. Wandering through the shopping centre is like wandering around a maze of shops in Tokyo City, sauntering down London’s Carnaby Street, bagging a bargain in an Istanbul souk, eating at the Fisherman’s Wharf in San Francisco. The atrium looks a bit like an airport with floor signs that signal the arrivals in particular cities, electronic display boards bring to mind flight information displays at an airport terminal, and the information desk receptionists wear flight attendant uniforms.

And there are various props that one can pose next to for photos. I decided my quest is to take a photo of myself next to every prop I can find, so I enlisted the help of various strangers who are visiting the mall. Many were very cooperative, one Indian guy took dozens of photos of me in various poses. Two Italians (actually, they told me they were from the Republic of San Marino) took various photos of me next to a Vespa scooter, and they said they were trying to get a photo that was optimal from the perspective of the scooter as well as myself. All in all, it was great fun, and a fantastic way to chill out before packing for the flight. I finished off with a strawberry ice cream sundae from Swensens.
