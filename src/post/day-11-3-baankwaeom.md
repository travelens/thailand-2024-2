We rented out a house at [Baankwaeom Boutique Homestay](http://www.baankwaeom.com/index.php) บ้านแควอ้อมบูติคโฮมสเตย์อัมพวา, beside the Khwae Om canal. It is called Tara House, and it is a very interesting property. The ground floor is a living room, a kitchen and 2 bathrooms. Upstairs is a single bedroom that sleeps up to 8 people in 4 beds. Nearby is Baan Cafe which served us some food on arrival and will also serve us breakfast the next day. The property is owned by a friend of a friend of Cat.

When we arrived, I was surprised to see the place flooded with water and most of the lawns were covered with water. I was later told this is high tide and quite normal, and the water level does not get any higher than this.

We spent a lovely afternoon relaxing at the property, and I ended up dozing on the deck chair and also spent some time in the sauna. Life beside the canal is very peaceful and tranquil and after the hectic hustle and bustle of our trip so far, it is nice to be able to relax.
