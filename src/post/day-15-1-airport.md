We had preordered an Airport transfer that picked us up at 7am in the morning and we had an uneventlful journey to the airport, managed to check in successfully, then had breakfast at McDonalds. After that we waited for the flight to board, and happily discovered the flight was not very full - we had nobody sitting in the middle seat between us, and also the row in front, which had extra legroom, was empty.

We had a great flight back to Sydney, and landed at around 10pm at night and made it safely home.

This is a video of the impressive Samudra manthan sculpture at the airport:
