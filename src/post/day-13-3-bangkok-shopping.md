In the afternoon, I continued my exploration of Bangkok shopping centres within walking distance from the apartment where we stayed. I visited [Central Embassy](https://www.centralembassy.com), then [centralWorld](https://www.centralworld.co.th/en/home), and walked along the BTS Skyway.

centralwOrld was pretty much as I remembered it from 10 years, it is a huge shopping centre and takes quite some time to walk through it all. I ended up having dinner at the Thai food court in the Central Department Store, and it was good.
