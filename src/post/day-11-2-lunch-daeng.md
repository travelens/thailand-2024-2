[Daeng Seafood Restaurant](https://www.daengseafood.com/en/) แดงอาหารทะเล (40 ปี) ร้านต้นตำรับตัวจริงกว่า 40 ปี based in Samut Songkhram has been around nearly 40 years and is situated in an open area. The restaurant is partially an open air restaurant but we elected to sit inside. Wow, the seafood here is fresh and delicious, I really enjoyed every dish and felt this was one of the best restaurant meals I had in Thailand.

We had a variety of dishes, including razor clams, squid, pomfret, pork balls, tofu, pork balls and morning glory.
